# Data-structures-projects
## Projects Overview

In this repository, I have explored different uses for various types of data structures and algorithms. Each project focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm, demonstrating its implementation and practical applications. Below is a brief overview of structures used in some projects: 

1. **Linked Lists**
    - **Purpose:** To understand the implementation and usage of singly and doubly linked lists.
    - **Details:** This project includes operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal of linked lists.

2. **Binary Trees**
    - **Purpose:** To explore the concepts of binary trees, including binary search trees (BST).
    - **Details:** This project covers tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and BST operations.

3. **Graph Algorithms**
    - **Purpose:** To implement and analyze graph algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    - **Details:** This project includes graph representation, traversal, and pathfinding algorithms.

4. **Sorting Algorithms**
    - **Purpose:** To compare different sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort.
    - **Details:** This project provides a performance analysis of each sorting algorithm.

There are more projects within this repository and each project has its own README file that explains the implementation details, code structure, and usage instructions.
