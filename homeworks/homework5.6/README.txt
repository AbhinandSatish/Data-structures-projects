## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

When I was coding the main issues that I was having is that in functions I would forget to pass the head
by reference and that would cause my head to not get updated. The most prevalent time this issue happened
was when I tried coding the push_back function for my usernode List. I watched some videos on 
linked list to get a better grasp on how I could link the user nodes together from via the main.

The most challenging part of the homework was the match function that required you to grab the current
user's phonenumber and go through their likedUsers, go through the matched People's phonenumbers and see
if current user phone number appeared. 

What clicked for me while doing this homework was the memory deletion, it made sense that you would
delete the nodes in the way they are supposed to be deleted.
