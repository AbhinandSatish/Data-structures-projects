Learning Objectives
- Practice managing dynamic memory.
- Practice using two-dimensional arrays.

Specifics: 
- There are 500 users in total and it is index from 0-->499
- There are 110 movies in total and it is indexed from 0 --> 99

-- index and name of all movies are in the main.cpp in a list 
-- need to define a class recommendation.cpp most of the code is given to us but it is incomplete
        -- Class REcommendation requirements:
                - Must have atleast two member variables, it can have more definitly if needed
                    - userMovieRatingsMatrix
                    - userShowRatingMatrix 
                            -- both are 2D arrays so use "int**" as pointer
                        - Two member functions to your class are provided, and you can call but should not modify these two functions.\


-- USER INFORMATION AND STUFF:
-----Two input files are provided: movieRatings.txt and showRatings.txt.
        - Each line of the text file is the text file represents one user
        -- the rating of the movie is in a range of 1 to 5
        ----> The first line of movieRatings.txt means, user 0 gives a rating of 3 to movie 87, gives a rating of 1 to 
                movie 11, gives a rating of 1 to movie 14, gives a rating of 4 to moving 31, gives a rating of 4 to movie 101, gives a rating of 2 to movie 21, etc.

        ----> The second line of 
        movieRatings.txt means, user 1 gives a rating of 1 to movie 6, gives a rating of 2 to movie 61, gives a rating of 2 to movie 109, gives a rating of 4 to moving 87, 
            gives a rating of 4 to movie 28, gives a rating of 5 to movie 38, etc.

        ----> The 3rd line descirbes ratings given by user 2, the 4th line describes ratings given by user 3, etc.

        ----> The file showRatings.txt can be interpreted in the same way. It is just ratings in that file are for tv shows. 
        In this assignment, your program should read these two input files and store the movie ratings in a matrix, and store the show ratings in another matrix.


####### IMportant notes:
In this assignment, you are NOT allowed to use std::vector anywhere in your code. You must use dynamic memory to store the movie rating matrix, and the show rating matrix.

Use good coding style when you design and implement your program. Organize your program into functions: donâ€™t put all the code in main!
